# Palidromes-Java-

Palindromes:

A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward as forward. For instance "civic" or "deed" 

are palindromes while "toyota" is not.

Given a list of words

Your task is to

 write a function that rearranges their letters so that they become palindromes

o for example, having the sequence “cecarar” we can rearrange the letters and 

obtain “racecar” which is a palindrome

 print to the standard output (stdout) a single line containing one palindrome that can be 

obtained from the initial word by rearranging its letters or -1 if it’s not possible to obtain a 

palindrome (for each of the given words)

 please note that the palindromes don't have to be necessarily real words from the English 

dictionary (e.g. dbd is a valid palindrome word)

Note that your function will receive the following arguments:

 words

o which is an array of strings giving the words that need to have their letters 

rearranged to obtain palindromes
